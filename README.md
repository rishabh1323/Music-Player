Heyy there!!
This is a basic Music Player Project made by me - Rishabh Dingliwal... feel free to have a look ;)

Some points to note: 

1. Open the 'Symphony Studio' html file to begin.
2. Hover over the bottom section of the webpage to see the music player (it does contains some functionalities).
3. There's a navigation button in dropdown button 'Queue' to navigate between 'Queue' and 'My Playlist'.
4. Click on any icon in the 'Popular Artists' section to go to a separate webpage.
5. Here you can navigate back to the main webpage using the 'Home' icon on top.
6. The separate webpage also contains the music player functionality on hover.
 
Thanks!  : ) : ) : )
